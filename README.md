# Testing Facial Recognition with different images and folders.
We did the Initial testing with the main open source project we used. The main open source-program was able to detect people like Obama and Biden. We were able to add specific people of our choosing as well. We just had to make sure we follow the same protocol, which is two separate pictures of the exact person. The two separate pictures had to be in two separate folders. We can name the folder anything, as long as it makes sense. The names can be unknown_pictures and known_pictures. Then we run a face_recognition command with each of the folders and the output would detect the unknown pictures with the known pictures.
