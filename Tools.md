# Tools for the facial Recognition Program
We used tools such as Dlib, Flask, face_recognition module, python os module

# Flask
Flask is a Python-based web framework that has necessary tools, technologies, and libraries for creating web applications. For our project it is needed to handle user input. It allows users to upload images to uknown and known sections of the website. It also allows users to be able to access the website through an ip address url 

# Dlib 
Dlib is essential for the face_recognition tool because it ensures a solid use of the tool.

# face_recognition module 
This is a tool that loads in images, processes images, and detect certain features of the images. It specifically detects the encoding of images. The encoding of images is bascially each pixel of an image. So, this tool detects every possible aspect of a certain image.

# Python os module 
This is an import that allows python code to interact with the operating system. Python modules most of the time are not built in the system, so it is crucial that it is imported into a python program in the terminal. If it is not imported, os functions will not work and the program will get errors based on the os functions.
