# Face Recognition With GUI 
We created code that deploys a front end website. The website serves as a GUI to neatly run the face_recognition tool as opposed to runnning it via the command line. The website is generated using the python3 program we created, faceapp.py, command from the terminal. The website allows the user to add any photo and the website will detect the person based on the information the user provides.

The GUI front end is compromised of a framework including 5 different folders- Static, Templates, Known_Persons, Unknown_Persons, and faceapp.py.
