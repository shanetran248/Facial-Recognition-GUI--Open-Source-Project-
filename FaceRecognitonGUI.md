# Face Recognition With GUI 
We added code that opens up a front end website GUI. It does the same thing as running the face_recognition command in the command line. But, instead of using the face_recognition command we run a python3 command, which runs the python code and generates a GUI. In this website we can add any photo we want and the website will detect the person based on our folders.
