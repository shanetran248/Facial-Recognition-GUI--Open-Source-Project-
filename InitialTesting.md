# Testing Facial Recognition with different images and folders.
We did the initial testing with facial recognition open source project. 
<p><br></p>
The open source-program setup instructions recommended starting out with clear, non-cluttered images. They used photographs of Joe Biden and Barrack Obama for their examples- we got started by doing the same.
<p><br></p>
We then transitioned to adding people of our choosing- we just had to make sure we followed the same protocol, which is two separate pictures of the exact person. 
<p><br></p>
To clarify, the two separate pictures had to be in two separate folders. We can name the folder anything, as long as it makes sense. For clarity, our team went with the names "unknown_person" and known_person".
<p><br></p>
Then, complining each of the folders with the face_recognition command, the output would detect the unknown pictures with the known pictures. 
<p><br></p>
Our goal from there was to create something on top of this tool, ultimately settling on an accessible GUI
